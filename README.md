# MediCall AI Prototype

## Overview
MediCall is an AI-powered voice assistant that automates insurance verification calls, saving clinicians 25% of their administrative time. This prototype demonstrates the core "magic moment" where AI takes over routine phone calls.

## Key Features Demonstrated
- **AI Voice Assistant**: Simulates automated insurance verification calls
- **Real-time Call Monitoring**: Live progress tracking of AI calls
- **Instant Results**: Immediate verification results with confidence scores
- **Time Savings Visualization**: Shows actual time saved vs manual processes

## The Magic Moment
Watch as the AI assistant:
1. ðŸ“ž Dials insurance providers automatically
2. ðŸ¤– Navigates phone menus using voice recognition
3. ðŸ‘¥ Speaks with representatives to verify coverage
4. ðŸ“‹ Extracts and structures verification data
5. âœ… Delivers results in under 4 minutes (vs 15-20 minutes manually)

## Quick Start

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Application**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

3. **Open Browser**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:5000`

4. **Try the Demo**
